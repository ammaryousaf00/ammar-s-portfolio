    <h1 style="color: white;">Database management system</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">In this mini project, I designed and implemented a small-scale database system using MySQL and MS Access. The project focused on creating and managing data for a student/inventory management system. I developed tables, relationships, queries, and forms to store, update, and retrieve records efficiently. Basic SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE were used to manage data operations.
This project improved my understanding of database design, normalization, and data integrity, and enhanced my ability to apply SQL concepts in practical scenarios.</p>
