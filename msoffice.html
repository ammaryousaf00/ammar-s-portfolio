    <p style="color: white;">In this project, I utilized Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to create and present professional business documents. Using Word, I designed structured reports and formatted them with tables, styles, and page layouts. In Excel, I created automated spreadsheets using formulas and pivot tables for data organization and analysis. Finally, I used PowerPoint to develop a visually appealing presentation that summarized the findings and results.
This project strengthened my skills in data organization, reporting, and professional presentation design using the MS Office Suite.</p>
